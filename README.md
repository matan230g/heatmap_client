**BIOWEB** 

The project is a research project in the field of bioinformatics, focusing on the visualization and analysis of biological data, with an emphasis on microRNA data and genes.
 
The study of microRNA data has gained momentum in recent years thanks to new technologies that enable mapping the genome of living organisms. Genome mapping creates a huge amount of data that biological researchers must study in order to find connections between microRNAs and their target genes. Understanding these connections can lead to finding ways to treat many diseases. The most prominent example of the importance of microRNA is the COVID-19 vaccine, which is partly based on this technology.
 
Today, there are several microRNA data research systems that allow interactive visualization of the data along with the use of statistical algorithms to explore the data. However, the main disadvantage of these systems is that they do not support exploring two heat maps simultaneously, which impairs the user's ability to understand the connections between the different maps.
Our system is a unique web application that supports exploring two heat maps and the connections between them. In such a way, it is easier for the user to see the connections between the maps and find new insights. The system uses machine learning algorithms and statistics algorithms to find insights from the data and uses interactive visualization tools such as interactive heat maps to present the data in a user-friendly way.
